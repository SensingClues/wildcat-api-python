Tutorial
--------

Two Jupyter notebooks are included with the library.

1. ``notebooks/demo_notebook.py``:
    - This notebook is **intended for end users** who want to use the library as-is.
    - This notebook illustrates the available functionality.
2. ``notebooks/dev/api_maker.py``:
    - This notebook is **intended for developers** who wish to develop new functionality.
    - This notebook provides an example of how to develop new API-calls. The example provided is one to develop the (already existing) ``get_all_layers``.

Demo notebooks
##############

Examples of both notebooks, including output, are also added in this documentation, allowing you to view and understand the library's functionality without installing and running it.

.. note::
    The output shown in the notebooks is for dummy data only.
